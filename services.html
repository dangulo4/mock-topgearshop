        <h3>Dan Altilio Jr</h3>
        <p>
          In 1975 Dan was a founding member of the board of directors of Di Marzio Â® Pickups and served as
          vice-president until
          1985. During that time the company became known for innovation and excellence in design and manufacturing, and
          Dan was a
          critical team member in advancing the art and science of guitar technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the years prior to founding TOP GEAR Dan had the opportunity to do custom work or build instruments for
          several
          famous players including Pete Townshend, Rick Derringer, Steve Morse, Billy Sheehan, Earl Slick (David Bowie,
          John
          Lennon), Vinnie Zummo (Joe Jackson) Kasim Sultan (The New Cars) and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now in business for over twenty-five years, TOP GEAR has acquired the highest reputation for service and
          excellence, and
          Dan is proud that he was able to make his dream of "The Best of Everything For The Professional Guitarist"
          come true.

        <h3>Tim Pinnell</h3>
        <p>
          A native San Diegan, Tim had already established a reputation among local musicians as a tube amp whiz when he
          brought
          his considerable talents to TOP GEAR. As Dan recalls, "He brought in his modified Fender Bassman head and it
          sounded
          better than my own amp which had been done by a famous New York amp shop! I said, 'And you want to work here?
          Sounds
          good to me!'"
        </p>

        <p>
          You don't learn how to build, modify and repair vacuum tube amplifiers by going to school. Tim learned his
          craft through
          a unique combination of basic electronics courses in high school, working for a man who himself was an expert
          in the
          field and who had written a book on the subject, and good old fashioned do-it-yourself experimentation. Plus,
          he owns a
          pretty good set of ears, without which you can't hope to be any good at what Tim does.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the process of becoming an expert himself, Tim acquired the uncanny ability to look at a circuit board and
          by
          understanding circuit theory, to draw out a schematic himself if one wasn't available! This has proven
          invaluable in his
          chosen profession, since schematics are often unavailable for many older amps and other gear.

        <h3>Mike Boone</h3>
        <p>
          Mike was first a customer of ours back in the early days when our reputation was young. He brought his guitars
          in to
          have custom work done and in the process we got to know him. As the years began to roll by, Mike continued to
          shop at
          TOP GEAR and expressed a desire to work here. When the opportunity to set up a production line came along,
          Mike's
          previous experience proved invaluable and we asked him onboard to be our guitar builder. Over the course of
          the run,
          Mike built hundreds of guitars from raw parts, hand wiring pickguards and jig drilling and mounting bridges
          and tremolo
          systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the time the manufacturing job had run its course, Mike had not only obtained vast experience setting up
          guitars, he
          had acquired the TOP GEAR attitude of uncompromising quality. As he put it, he learned to "use The Force." Now
          with us
          almost twenty years, "the new guy" is a Fender GOLD Certified electric guitar service technician and has
          become an
          essential part of our team.
